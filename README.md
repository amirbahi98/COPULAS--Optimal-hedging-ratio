# COPULAS-Optimal-Hedging-Ratios
# Archimedean Copula models (Clayton Copula, Frank Copula, and Gumbel Copula)
 The price series of Saffron Strands and Lotus Gold Investment Fund from the Iran Mercantile Exchange and Tehran Stock Exchange are analyzed. Static hedging models such as OLS and VAR models, as well as dynamic hedging models like Normal Copula and Archimedean Copula models (Clayton Copula, Frank Copula, and Gumbel Copula), are employed. The main objective is to calculate the optimal hedging ratios for Saffron Strands (Negin) and Lotus Gold Investment Fund. Additionally, the study compares the effectiveness of static and dynamic hedging models using the minimum variance method. The findings indicate that during the studied period of Saffron Strands (2018-2022), the Normal Copula model provides a higher optimal hedging ratio compared to other models. Similarly, for Lotus Gold Investment Fund during the studied period (2021-2022), the Gumbel Copula model offers a higher optimal hedging ratio. Furthermore, both Frank Copula and Gumbel Copula models show better performance (higher Edrington index) for Saffron Strands and Lotus Gold Investment Fund futures compared to other models, respectively
